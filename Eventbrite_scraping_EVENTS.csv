About this event
Welcoming all Tequila & Cocktail Enthusiasts! We will begin by tasting 3 spirits from all around Jalisco & Oaxaca. Next we’ll brainstorm how we can create 2 unique cocktails with local fruit, an array of bitters, herbs, & spices!
These agave based spirits will incorporate the Dale DeGroff methodology of bartending. He was an influential force behind the craft cocktail world. In 1960 Dale was notorious for swapping artificial sour mixes and syrups for narural ingredients & fresh citrus. Re-introducing the public to long-forgotten classics techniques of bartending.
If you’d like to book this experience for a private groups: great for birthdays, bachelor[ettes], corporate retreats, great for team-building, etc. If one a day that is not posted on the calendar, just please contact me; depending on the day I can accommodate. I offer several fun and engaging structured cocktail experiences from competitions, fire demonstrations, and Olympic styled challenges for all experience levels.
Let’s transform a classic cocktail with fresh seasonal ingredients!! Consider ride-sharing due to high alcohol consumption.

In partnership with Diptyque and Thompson Buckhead, Buckhead Village invites you to an evening workshop centered around seasonal fragrances and thoughtfully-crafted cocktails. Thompson Buckhead’s ever-talented Head of Beverage, Thandi Walton will guide you through the art of crafting the perfect cocktail, inspired by the cult-favorite fragrances of Diptyque. Guests will get to select from three signature Diptyque scents – Ambre, Baies and Do Son – and let the fragrance notes infuse their cocktail recipe.
Your ticket includes:
A gift from Diptyque – select from an Ambre or Baies 190g candle or Do Son 50ml fragrance ($72-$115 value).
E﻿verything you need to craft one delicious cocktail inspired by Diptyque fragrances - Ambre Old Fashioned, Baies Bramble and Do Son Collins.
Lite bites to enjoy during class.
2-hour parking validation. Applicable for Buckhead Village parking decks only, not valet.
Y﻿ou will get to experience and sample all three fragrance x cocktail combinations before selecting the cocktail you would like to make. Please note there are limited seats for each cocktail, so selections are on a first come basis.
The Mixology Workshop will take place in the beautiful, weather-protected, open-air area of The Veranda – located at the corner of Bolling Way and Buckhead Avenue, across from Le Bilboquet.
Event is rain or shine, event space is covered and weather-protected.
About Diptyque
It all began on the left bank of Paris, in 1961, when three aesthetic adventurers with eclectic passions and a marked sense of style opened a boutique at 34 boulevard Saint-Germain. It was perhaps the world’s first concept store, resembling a chic bazaar offering the founders’ creations – fabrics, wallpaper, and pot-pourri – as well as interesting things they found on their trips all over the world. Since this time, diptyque has conquered the heart of Paris as a whole, before also traveling to the four corners of the Earth to share its very unique art of living. Everywhere, those in the know recognize the signs – the typeface, the dancing letters, the black and white, the iconic ovals on the bottles (whose original design hangs upon the wall) – which all serve as promises of sensory experiences and daily pleasures.
About Thandi Walton, Head of Beverage at Thompson Buckhead
Thandi Walton (@ThandiPoursCocktails) is a true hospitality professional with a deep love of travel and a palate to entertain the masses. A native to the country of Zimbabwe, upon relocating to the states she started her career as a bartender elevating into management and holds 20 years of experience within the industry. Thandi prides herself most on the use of her talents to creatively pair flavors in crafting memorable cocktails that have become mainstays on bar menus throughout Atlanta.
At Thompson Buckhead, Thandi cultivates their bar program as Head of Beverage. She is an educator and speaker within the industry, being featured as the best and brightest in publications such as The Atlantan, Forbes, Imbibe Magazine, and the Atlanta Journal Constitution. Her cocktails have been featured in Food & Wine Magazine, Peachtree TV’s Atlanta Eats, Fox 5’s Good Day Atlanta and TV One’s Sister Circle, which highlights master chefs and mixologists of color. Currently, she hosts “Together with Thandi” events every Thursday at the Thompson Buckhead’s lobby bar where she chooses a different spirit to feature each month and curates a menu of exclusive cocktails for her guests – complete with live DJ entertainment.
About Thompson Buckhead
Opened in December 2021, the 201-room Thompson Buckhead offers sweeping views of midtown Atlanta paired with a residential feel that blends southern charm design with mid-century modern touches. Centrally located in Buckhead Village, it sits on a quiet stretch within walking distance to Atlanta’s acclaimed, upscale neighborhood, allowing guests easy access to an enclave of shopping, dining and entertainment without venturing too far from the property. On-site, the Thompson Buckhead boasts Dirty Rascal, an incredible restaurant led by celebrated local chef Todd Ginsberg, featuring an Italian-American menu, extensive wine list, and a vibe that exudes old-school New York. On the top floor sits Tesserae, a members-only rooftop social club - and the Thompson brand’s first foray into the private club space - that welcomes a mix of local creatives, influential innovators and industry leaders, with the purpose of fostering a diverse community that blurs the lines between work and play.
The Mixology Workshop will take place in the beautiful, weather-protected, open-air area of The Veranda – located at the corner of Bolling Way and Buckhead Avenue, across from Le Bilboquet.

About this event
Laughs are uncorked for this nationwide tour that has already hit over 1500 wineries and breweries across the US!
Dozens of stand-up comics are currently on the road hailing from New York to L.A. and everywhere in between. While sampling the local brews, they will be providing the finest and funniest in comedy entertainment!
This lineup features comics whose credits include top festivals, TV/Netflix specials and major club appearances. Specific comedians are announced in the days prior to the shows via Shezmu Cellars' facebook page and instagram page. Follow @shezmucellars to stay in the know!
Find out which local craft libations pair best with hysterical laughter! Tickets are available that include drinks:
Beer Lover - admission and your first pour from one of our 30 taps
Wine Lover - admission and your first glass of wine
Admission Only
Admission is $20 at the door so take advantage of these online only deals!
NOTE: Seating is first-come-first-served so arrive 15 minutes early to ensure you get a good seat... these shows often sell out!
Shezmu Cellars is an urban winery producing local honey-wines (mead) while also pouring 30 taps of craft beer and over 25 wines from North Georgia wine country. Shezmu Cellars believes mead doesn’t have to be a sweet dessert wine and focuses on producing sessionable dry meads served carbonated, nitrogenated, and still. Voted Best Winery in Georgia in 2020 by the Georgia Business Journal, the Marietta winery is available as a venue for private events and hosts monthly art exhibits and comedy shows among the occasional themed party.
FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS:
Is parking available?
--- Yes, there is plenty of free parking in the lot in front of the winery... but if you're planning on drinking, please plan on taking a Lyft, Uber or designate a driver!
Do I need to print my tickets?
--- No! We will be able to check you in electronically.
Is only wine available?
--- Nope! We have lots of wine, including a huge Georgia wine selection as well as Sake and other wine-based beverages. We also have 30 taps of craft beer and some domestics in bottles/cans. We do not serve liquor.
Is there a kitchen on site?
--- Unfortunately no. We often have food vendors at our events, but if we do not advertise them then our offerings will include charcuterie, chocolate and other bar snack options. However, we allow customer to bring in whatever food they like so feel free to use your favorite delivery service or bring in take-out!

Sophisticated Simplicity
Our events offer a fresh alternative to speed dating and matchmaking. We don't find anything romantic about whistles, name-tags or over-the-top party trimmings typically found at singles events so we have done away with them. Creating an atmosphere that is at once casual and comfortable. It's what we call cheeky-chic!
Meet a partner to attend concerts, music festivals, bar crawls or fitness classes. Someone who shares your passions and interests - from sports to yoga - all in a setting just your speed. 
-
Our personable hosts will assist you with your MyCheekyDate 'Date-Mate' Scorecard. Flirty and fun, your Scorecard is just the beginning. Chat up our Hosts for tips or simply to ask, which direction the bar is in! After being shown to your table, the ladies will remain seated for the duration of the event. The gents move from lovely lady to lovely lady every six to seven minutes. Simply jot down your potential 'Date-Mates' at the bottom of your Scorecard and we'll take care of the rest. For those who garner matches, you will be notified via e-mail within 24 hours of the event ending of your 'Date-Mate' results.Alas, the event is over but the night has just begun. Feel free to stay as long as you would like to mingle further. All we need are the 'Date-Mate' Scorecards to determine if love is in the air for you.
Offering uncompromising value with unparalleled service. Lovely venues and our lovely Hosts to assist you with anything or anyone.

A Battle for the Ages
United States vs France
We live in a “Golden Age” of fine wine. As the United States continues to gain notoriety for its wines, France is ever refining its rich heritage. But this begs the question- when paired against each other who will come out on top?
Join us for an engaging and interactive “Battle Royale” between The United States and France! Vote for your favorite wines through five rounds, paired expertly with incredible dishes from our amazing culinary team. We expect there will be upsets and surprises - and only one can win!

About this event
For the fall and winter season Share on Sunday will host a weekly bottle share at Tropical Express. Share beer, shop plants, enjoy music and watch the Falcons game. Food will also be available for purchase.
W﻿hat is a bottle share? A bottle share is a gathering of individuals where each person brings beer to open and share with other attendees.
W﻿hat type of beer? Any type of craft beer that you like! And want others to try!
W﻿hat is craft beer? Craft beer is generally made with traditional ingredients like malted barley; interesting and sometimes non-traditional ingredients are often added for distinctiveness. Craft brewers tend to be very involved in their communities through philanthropy, product donations, volunteerism and sponsorship of events.
W﻿here can I purchase craft beer? We would love you to support locally! Here are a few local businesses where you can pick up your beer:
R﻿ed's Beer Garden
H﻿op City Craft Beer & Wine
B﻿eer Girl, Growlers & Bottleshop
T﻿he Tap on Ponce
A﻿le Yeah!
M﻿y Friend's Bottle Shop
H﻿orshu's Craft Beer & Quality Wine
S﻿prayberry
S﻿tout Brothers
L﻿ocal Vine
W﻿hat is Tropical Express? Tropical Express is a plant shop located on the Upper Westside of Atlanta. Actually, it's more than a plant shop, it's a peaceful escape! Tropical Express is open for those just beginning their plant journey, those who need an escape from the everyday shuffle of the city life, and for those who are advanced looking for that “hidden treasure of rare plants”. Our focus is making you feel at home while providing a personable experience. We take pride in customers enjoying our shop and helping curate ""the vibe"" in spaces of their own. Come visit us as you shop for plants. We're located in the heart of Westside Atlanta, 970 Jefferson Street Atlanta, GA 30318.""
R﻿ULES:
1﻿. You must bring something to share to participate.
2﻿. Must bring good energy to share with the plants.
3﻿. You are responsible for whatever and/or whoever you bring or invite to the share.

Sophisticated Simplicity
Our events offer a fresh alternative to speed dating and matchmaking. We don't find anything romantic about whistles, name-tags or over-the-top party trimmings typically found at singles events so we have done away with them. Creating an atmosphere that is at once casual and comfortable. It's what we call cheeky-chic!
Meet a partner to attend concerts, music festivals, bar crawls or fitness classes. Someone who shares your passions and interests - from sports to yoga - all in a setting just your speed. 
-
Our personable hosts will assist you with your MyCheekyDate 'Date-Mate' Scorecard. Flirty and fun, your Scorecard is just the beginning. Chat up our Hosts for tips or simply to ask, which direction the bar is in! After being shown to your table, the ladies will remain seated for the duration of the event. The gents move from lovely lady to lovely lady every six to seven minutes. Simply jot down your potential 'Date-Mates' at the bottom of your Scorecard and we'll take care of the rest. For those who garner matches, you will be notified via e-mail within 24 hours of the event ending of your 'Date-Mate' results.Alas, the event is over but the night has just begun. Feel free to stay as long as you would like to mingle further. All we need are the 'Date-Mate' Scorecards to determine if love is in the air for you.
Offering uncompromising value with unparalleled service. Lovely venues and our lovely Hosts to assist you with anything or anyone.

It's all about what you Relish and finding someone to Relish those things with. If you're tired of online dating, exhausted by meeting someone only to discover they're nothing like their profile - we offer an alternative. Bringing together comfortably chic venues with a cosmopolitan sensibility. A sophisticated no frills approach to singles events. We've done away with the whistles, name-tags and over the top party trimmings. Unparalleled service and personable hosts all in an environment - just your speed. A fresh alternative to typical events that seem more like a job fair than a relaxed way to connect.
Whether it be a romantic dinner, wine tasting, concert or festival - bar crawl or fitness class - maybe even a Mud Run! Do what you Relish with whom you Relish.
Speed Dating @ Divan Restaurant - November 15th 2022

We think the best relationships are forged when we are comfortable, relaxed and free of pressure. Preferring instead to think of the evening as a casual night out where one can truly be themselves. We do not use traditional 'speed dating' offerings such as bells, whistles and name-tags. Instead we focus on creating an atmosphere conducive to meeting others; a great venue, a personable host and a staff to assist.
Upon arriving at your chosen event - locate your event host. Your host will assist in setting you up with your scorecard for the evening. A simple and convenient way to keep track of whom you enjoyed meeting and those that you would like to see again. Should you have any questions - feel free to ask away. Take the time before the event starts to settle in - have a beverage if you would like and mingle should you wish. The speed dating portion of the event begins once all daters have arrived, checked in and had a moment or two to relax and unwind.
During the event, Ladies will stay seated and the Gentleman will rotate from table to table every 5 - 6 minutes. Our host will guide the Gentleman to let them know when their time is up and facilitate in seeing them to the next table. The goal is to find someone you would like to speak with further. Don't fret about figuring out if person is the one or the perfect person for you. Consider it the date before the date. Select those you would like to meet again and give the completed scorecard back to your host at the end of the evening. Our staff will tabulate the results and email you the following day with your results. If you choose someone and they chose you - it's a match. You will be given each others first name and email address. The rest is up to you.

For those that prefer the same simplified experience in Matchmaking, we offer our 'Date-Nights' free of contracts and commitments. With packages ranging from $395 to $745. For more information; Click Here!

Sophisticated Simplicity
Our events offer a fresh alternative to speed dating and matchmaking. We don't find anything romantic about whistles, name-tags or over-the-top party trimmings typically found at singles events so we have done away with them. Creating an atmosphere that is at once casual and comfortable. It's what we call cheeky-chic!
Meet a partner to attend concerts, music festivals, bar crawls or fitness classes. Someone who shares your passions and interests - from sports to yoga - all in a setting just your speed. 
-
Our personable hosts will assist you with your MyCheekyDate 'Date-Mate' Scorecard. Flirty and fun, your Scorecard is just the beginning. Chat up our Hosts for tips or simply to ask, which direction the bar is in! After being shown to your table, the ladies will remain seated for the duration of the event. The gents move from lovely lady to lovely lady every six to seven minutes. Simply jot down your potential 'Date-Mates' at the bottom of your Scorecard and we'll take care of the rest. For those who garner matches, you will be notified via e-mail within 24 hours of the event ending of your 'Date-Mate' results.Alas, the event is over but the night has just begun. Feel free to stay as long as you would like to mingle further. All we need are the 'Date-Mate' Scorecards to determine if love is in the air for you.
Offering uncompromising value with unparalleled service. Lovely venues and our lovely Hosts to assist you with anything or anyone.

Would you like to experience the finest expression of Scotch whisky produced today? Would you like to expand your knowledge of Scotch and the many styles and flavours that make up quality whisky?
Join The Scotch Malt Whisky Society for a rare single malt Scotch whisky tasting experience at Buena Vida Tapas & Sol in Atlanta! Attendees will be among the first to taste nine (9) unique single malts from our upcoming December Outturn in a festival style walk-around tasting designed to celebrate our whisky community and its appreciation for Scotch whisky. The holidays are coming so let's toast to a happy and healthy season together!
Based in Edinburgh, Scotland, The Scotch Malt Whisky Society is the world’s largest whisky club of whisky lovers. More than just a club, the Society is known for offering the finest expression of Scotch whisky produced today. It acquires exceptional whisky casks from distilleries across Scotland and beyond. Each cask is then bottled and offered exclusively to its community of members through the Society’s online shop smwsa.com.
While Society whisky is available for purchase by members only, this event is open to anyone eager to taste and learn in the company of fellow whisky lovers. Members enjoy a reduced price for admission and all attendees who order tickets before November 16th will get the early bird special pricing.

Do you need ideas on what wine(s) to serve with Thanksgiving dinner or a suggestion on a special bottle to bring as a gift to your host? Join us on Wednesday, November 16 from 5-8 pm as we do a special tasting for the Fall season. We’ll have 12 different wines in a range of varietals and price points available to try, along with a light food spread. This is a great opportunity to learn about pairings, ask questions and purchase wines to take home for that special dinner you’re hosting or attending in late November. Guests receive a 10% discount on any bottles purchased at the event as well as a raffle ticket into the prize giveaway that will be happening at the December Holiday Wine Tasting.

About this event
This event will be one that you don’t want to miss! Instead of a winery trip, Shunte’, the owner, thought about bringing an Intimate Experience to a local venue.
This evening will include networking with like-minded women, a wine tasting experience from a local wine sommelier, utilizing your creativity to paint a beautiful portrait representing the “essence of a woman” while sipping on featured wines, listening to some good music vibes, enjoying some hors d'oeuvres creations by a local chef, spinning on the 360 photobooth while taking fabulous photos, and more. We have a special guest appearance by Mahogany Joy Speaks that will grace us with some original spoken word pieces! Every guest will leave with a Purposed-Life keepsake and wanting more!
ATTIRE: CHIC AND SASSY IN SHADES OF PINK, BLACK, AND WHITE

A long-time veteran of the Atlanta restaurant scene, Chef Drew joins the Farm Burger herd with over 27 years of experience in fine-dining and a passion for local farming and sourcing.
He is a graduate of the Culinary Institute of America and has perfected his skills studying under world-renowned chefs such as Jean-Louis Palladin, Guenter Seeger, Wylie Dufresne, Joel Antunes, Sam Mason, and Mark Dommen. In the past decade, he has led Buckhead’s Seven Lamps kitchen as executive chef and operating partner where he spent eight years creating handmade pastas, wood-fired meats, and seasonal and locally farmed vegetables. Most recently, he was executive chef at Atlanta favorite, Ecco Buckhead, where he implemented his unique cooking style to introduce dishes highlighting locally sourced ingredients.
“I have been a fan of Drew’s cooking for a number of years, and I couldn’t pick a better person to join our team,” said George Frangos, co-owner and founder of Farm Burger. “At Farm Burger, the quality of our offerings, from locally-sourced pasture-raised meats to final product are paramount, and Drew is completely aligned with our vision. He’s already bringing a new and exciting energy to our culture and to our menus.”
Chef Drew has been recognized for his outstanding culinary skills in respected industry and local publications throughout his career. In 2004, Food & Wine magazine recognized him as a “Chef on the Rise” during his tenure at Toast. In 2006, he was appointed executive chef of Saga restaurant where he received the “Rising Star Award” from StarChefs.com and “Most Memorable Plate of 2007” from Creative Loafing. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution has also previously awarded him three stars for his creations. He is best known for developing and launching his own handmade pasta, Pan De Mie Pasta Company.

Cooking is a great way to spend time together – especially when you don’t have to worry about the planning, shopping or clean-up! So, grab your kid(s), grandparents, goofy uncle, favorite auntie, or even some family friends and let’s make some delicious memories together! Ages 4+ please!
Come as a pair, or small group! At our Sunday Supper, adult(s) and kid(s) work side-by-side to make a meal, and then enjoy it together. It’s the perfect combination of family fun activity, meets hands-on instructional cooking, with a delicious dinner result, and recipes you can later recreate at home!
All classes include: Hands-On Instruction lead by one of our talented and kid-friendly instructors, all food and non-alcoholic beverages and professional printed take-home recipes.
Put a smile on someone's face by baking some sweet holiday treats - cookies and adorable sweet treats will be made by groups and then exchanged. Everyone will enjoy some cookies with hot coco, and take home the rest! No other food except the cookies/treats will be made/consumed. Please plan accordingly.
Menu to Include:
Homemade Hot Coco with Chocolate Dipped Candy Cane Marshmallow Sticks
Variety of cookies that will be shared (Please note that egg, dairy and nuts will be used)

You can enjoy inside and outside during the tastings and no matter if you want to sit around our community table inside, walk around and mingle, catch some fresh air while sipping outside, shop the store and relax or break out a move on the dance floor after tasting, you're at the right place.
Our Wine consists of a cellar of all artisan / boutique wine and simply put means non-mass produced wine and can't be found in grocery or package stores, only in fine restaurants. Our winemakers are in it for the love, passion and art of wine making and often have passed their wineries down in their families from generation to generation. The quality comes shining through on your palate.
Wine selections are pre-determined and displayed at the tasting bar. We will be tasting 6 different wines in palette order. Regular Wine Tasting will have selections across the white and red palate range and Specialized Wine Tasting will focus on a specific topic for the tastings.
Admission cost paid includes a $5 event fee to cover tasting costs and the remainder of the cost is a usable cover to spend on any store items except optional wine tasting flights. Wine Tastings are a great way to expand your palate, find new wine that you have never experienced before and meet new friends that share your same passion for wine. Bring your friends for a fun and relaxing evening and taste the latest additions to our wine portfolio. Reservations are requested and tickets are required.

About this event
Be transported to the patisseries of Paris with this classic French Macaron class!
Don your chef aprons, grab your whisks and lets get baking! In this fun and interactive class, you will learn the fine art to making these mouthwatering morsels that are easy enough to be done in your own kitchen! The classic 'Gerbert' or 'Paris Macaron' is a French meringue-based almond sandwich cookie. The celebrated original tea shop Ladurée on the Champs-Elysees in Paris is given credit for the invention of the classic French-style filled macaroon. However the cookies themselves are thought to have actually originated in Italy during the Renaissance. Their name comes from the Italian word “maccherone” meaning fine dough.
Together with our classically trained Pastry Chef Instructor, we will demystify the making of these highly sought-after meringue-based sandwich cookies. Our Pastry Chef Instructor will take you through a detailed demonstration, before you will be guided step-by-step in replicating the process of meringue mixing, otherwise known as 'macaronage', piping, baking, assembling and of course, eating! We will also explore a few flavour profiles and filling variations to make your macarons really stand out from the rest!
No experience is required! We provide all the equipment and ingredients, which are easy to find at local markets if you don’t already have them in your home kitchen. Our events are casual and meant to be fun and instructive, not hardcore. This class is designed to be just as fun for the baking enthusiast who wants to be a part of every step as it is for the first-timer who’s happier observing and assisting.
Guests in the same booking party will work together throughout the class by sharing ingredients and equipment. Please arrive 15 minutes early to check in, wearing your mask. Please note that class will be hosted in Chef Jean's apartment complex with ample space to social distance booking parties from one another. Chef Jean is also maintaining a sanitized space, for your safety, as per CDC guidelines. You are invited to BYOB beer, wine, or champagne with you to class.
Book on CocuSocial website directly to avoid additional fees and check most updated schedule: French Macaron
**You will receive a confirmation email from hello@cocusocial.com. If you don't receive it 24 hours after your booking, please contact us at hello@cocusocial.com

Frequently Asked Questions - Matchmaking
What information is exchanged with my ‘Date-Mate’ prior to our arranged date?
Prior to your arranged date, matched daters are only given each other's first names. After we consult with both daters, a night and venue is arranged with details of the venue, time and day of the meeting and the first name of your ‘Date-Mate’. Personal information such as e-mail, address or phone numbers are never exchanged by us and we urge our daters to use the same prudence.
Are events included in my Matchmaking Package?
Yes! A wonderful bonus to purchasing our Matchmaking Packages is the ability to attend our speed dating events at no additional charge to you. When you see an event you fancy attending - simply let us know and we'll add you to the guest list. There is no limit to the number of events you may attend with our compliments for the duration of your package. Attending events is an important part of the process and an excellent opportunity for us to get to know you better, for you to get to know our daters and for us to see who is drawn to you. As well, many Matchmaking daters find our events the perfect way to narrow down what they are looking for and learn a bit more about themselves in the process.
How can you charge so much less than the competition?
We don't have to spend money recruiting daters. We are sought after for who we are and the level of dater we attract, affording us the luxury of daters finding us, rather than the expense of having to find daters.
How do I let you know my preferences?
After you select your matchmaking package, you will receive a confirmation e-mail with details and questions to help us find your Date Mate. Tell us as much as you like! The more you offer, the better we can match. Our staff will review your preferences and get to work finding your match, making arrangements and sending you off on your date night.
Do I have to go to a venue or restaurant chosen by MyCheekyDate?
Of course not! You are free to choose any restaurant, venue or event you wish for your Date Night. Simply let us know what you have in mind so we may pass the reservation details onto your Date-Mate.
Am I obligated to use my Date Nights over a certain period of time?
You may use your Date Nights at your leisure.
What is the age range?
Our Matchmaking age range is similar to that of our events; our daters tend to be between early twenties to early forties.
What is ‘This, that and the other’?
Consider it our Concierge Service. Let us know what you need – everything from fashion tips to relationship advice, to being well-groomed. We have all the perks! Let us make your personal appointments or dinner reservations at the venue of your choice or ours - whilst you enjoy the lovely treatment.
What if I don't have the ability to act like a lady or gentleman?
Oh dear - how unfortunate. We do have a zero tolerance for any rudeness - of any sort. We attract such great daters but find - as in life - not every dater is ideal. Our daters are also our product and we go to great lengths to ensure everyone meets lovely daters. We want the right daters, not just any daters. Behavior short of lovely will result in a dater being banned from the company. This may upset some but we feel our daters as a whole appreciate the extra effort and we hope you do too.

35% Off Flash Sale | Offer Ends November 9th 2022
**Limited Quantity Available**
We wanted to bring a fresh alternative to countless forms, contracts and hours of consultations. Matchmakers claiming they have thousands of daters, but none explaining from where. While other Matchmakers are forced to find your match at bars, the mall or other unsavory locations, we meet a fantastic set of new singles every week from our events alone, allowing us the opportunity to choose for you the best out of an already great crowd. We also garner extremely busy Matchmaking daters who find our services an efficient dating indulgence. Sought after for the level of dater we attract, the personal service we offer and an unparalleled selection of the daters you want to meet. We're honored to find that special someone just for you.
Consider us your blind-date specialists! Inspired by the romantic and simple days gone by, we bring back the lovely idea of meeting a date, arranged by another, at a venue of your choosing. All communication between you and your Date-Mate prior to your Date-Night will be entirely through us.

Frequently Asked Questions - Matchmaking
What information is exchanged with my ‘Date-Mate’ prior to our arranged date?
Prior to your arranged date, matched daters are only given each other's first names. After we consult with both daters, a night and venue is arranged with details of the venue, time and day of the meeting and the first name of your ‘Date-Mate’. Personal information such as e-mail, address or phone numbers are never exchanged by us and we urge our daters to use the same prudence.
Are events included in my Matchmaking Package?
Yes! A wonderful bonus to purchasing our Matchmaking Packages is the ability to attend our speed dating events at no additional charge to you. When you see an event you fancy attending - simply let us know and we'll add you to the guest list. There is no limit to the number of events you may attend with our compliments for the duration of your package. Attending events is an important part of the process and an excellent opportunity for us to get to know you better, for you to get to know our daters and for us to see who is drawn to you. As well, many Matchmaking daters find our events the perfect way to narrow down what they are looking for and learn a bit more about themselves in the process.
How can you charge so much less than the competition?
We don't have to spend money recruiting daters. We are sought after for who we are and the level of dater we attract, affording us the luxury of daters finding us, rather than the expense of having to find daters.
How do I let you know my preferences?
After you select your matchmaking package, you will receive a confirmation e-mail with details and questions to help us find your Date Mate. Tell us as much as you like! The more you offer, the better we can match. Our staff will review your preferences and get to work finding your match, making arrangements and sending you off on your date night.
